# CMake
Two small examples for cmake and ctest.

## CMake
In several projects we developed options for cmake. Escpecially we figured out how to include doxygen for the creation of online documentations,
and options for C++ on Cygwin, Linux, OSX and Windows.

## CTest
Unit-Testing can be done with CMake. This small example shows a basic configuration for one unit test.
